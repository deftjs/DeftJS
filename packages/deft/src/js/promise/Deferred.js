/**
A Deferred is typically used within the body of a function that performs an 
asynchronous operation. When that operation succeeds, the Deferred should be 
resolved; if that operation fails, the Deferred should be rejected.

Once a Deferred has been resolved or rejected, it is considered to be complete 
and subsequent calls to resolve() or reject() are ignored.

Deferreds are the mechanism used to create new Promises. A Deferred has a 
single associated Promise that can be safely returned to external consumers 
to ensure they do not interfere with the resolution or rejection of the deferred 
operation.
